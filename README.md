New Yorkers are supposed to be tough. They're supposed to be resilient. They're supposed to be like this guy in a suit and tie riding a bike through the East Village in the rain. But I must confess, that even as a New Yorker with a deep love for my two-wheeled machine, I am a fair-weather cyclist. 

This is the kind of week I love to spend in the saddle. It's the middle of September 2020. It's balmy (red line), humdity is low (yellow line), and there is absolutely no rain (brown line). And during this week, (TK # cyclists) New Yorkers hopped on a Citi Bike and took a ride (blue line).

It was a welcomed week at the tail end of Summer's dog days where, like this Wednesday from August, the air was thick and hot and gave the city it's rainiest hour of the year. And although (TK # cyclists) braved the opprresive elements, the graph clearly shows that as rain began to fall in the late afternoon, ridership plummeted.

Am I not the only fair-weather cylcist in New York City? Do others who love to ride also hate the feeling of a water logged shoes and streaks of mudd running up their backs? Is there a statistically significant link between bike ridership and weather events like rain, temperature and humidity in New York City?


### The Data

To infer any possible links betwen ridershiip and weather, I turned to Citi Bike's [public system data and trip histories](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) and hourly Integrated Surface Data from the [National Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/search/index). Both datasets are easily accesible via the respective organization's websites, althought APIs and public S3 buckets are also availible.
